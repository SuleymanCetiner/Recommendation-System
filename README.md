As you know,recommendation system is a system where it returns some classes depending on user's choice.

To do that,we need to have customer dataset that reflect the choices and rating.
In this example,with Google,movie recommendation system is covered with public dataset.

Also you can shape this system into different domain.
After model generating,when you give some inputs,model returns the best choices for users.
Recommendation system also includes ranking,you can also list the requirements if needed.
